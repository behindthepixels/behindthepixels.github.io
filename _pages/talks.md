NVIDIA will show how RTX, DXR along with GameWorks, Ray Tracing can revolutionize gaming by significantly boosting the real-time rendering quality as well as accelerating the content creating process.In particular, NVIDIA will show state of the art real-time denoising technologies from GameWorks that will drastically bring down the cost of ray traced rendering of area light soft shadows, ambient occlusions, and glossy reflections so they become practical for real-time rendering. In addition NVIDIA will showcase how RTX and DXR can be used to conveniently implement offline light transport algorithms like path tracing in your game engine, and show the power of that for content creation process. Finally NVIDIA will also provide some tips and guideline for integrating DXR into your engine, and discuss open challenges.

Across graphics, audio, video, and physics, the NVIDIA VRWorks suite of technologies helps developers maximize performance and immersion for VR games and applications. This talk will explore the latest features of VRWorks, explain the VR-specific challenges they address, and provide application-level tips and tricks to take full advantage of these features. Special focus will be given to the details and inner workings of our latest VRWorks feature, Lens Matched Shading, along with the latest VRWorks integrations into Unreal Engine and Unity.

**Takeaway:** Attendees will gain an understanding of the unique challenges of real-time VR gaming and insight into the VRWorks suite of technologies.

### High-Performance, Low-Overhead Rendering with OpenGL and Vulkan
_GPU Technology Conference 2016_


![](/assets/images/pages/Vulkan Talk.jpg){: .align-left width="360px" }
As advanced games and applications continue to push the performance envelope, developers look to their 3D APIs for improved predictability, threading and reduced CPU load. New extensions to OpenGL and a totally new 3D API Vulkan are answering these requests directly. This session introduces and details both of these approaches a shows how applications can use OpenGL "AZDO" (Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) extensions like NVIDIA's Command Lists to greatly reduce single-threaded CPU overhead while reusing existing OpenGL code. Going further, the second section introduces the new 3D API from Khronos called Vulkan. Finally, there is a discussion of the tradeoffs of extended OpenGL and AZDO versus Vulkan, and how a developer might choose between them.
